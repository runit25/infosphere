# Security Recommendations

### Hyper-Threading / SMT 
  - Hyper-threading uses the same transistors already presently available on your CPU to increase performance by allowing multiple threads to run on the same physical core.
  - Resulting in a significant performance uplift depending on your workload at the cost of security, tdp and heat. Ultimately, however, it comes down to your threat model and risk tolerance.
  - Hyper-threading/SMT mode can be disabled via your manufacturer's BIOS to reduce your threat vector.

### Firmware & BIOS Updates
- Outdated BIOS/UEFI firmware may leave the system vulnerable to known exploits.  
- Vendors often release updates that include mitigations for CPU vulnerabilities.  
- **Recommendation**: Update BIOS/UEFI to improve security, performance, and compatibility.
