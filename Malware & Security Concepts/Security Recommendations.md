# Security Recommendations

### Hyper-Threading / SMT 
  - Hyper-threading uses the same transistors already presently available on your CPU to increase performance by allowing multiple threads to run on the same physical core.
  - Resulting in a significant performance uplift depending on your workload at the cost of security, tdp and heat. Ultimately, however, it comes down to your threat model and risk tolerance.
  - Hyper-threading/SMT mode can be disabled via your manufacturer's BIOS to reduce your threat vector.

### Firmware & BIOS Updates
- Outdated BIOS/UEFI firmware may leave the system vulnerable to known exploits.  
- Vendors often release updates that include mitigations for CPU vulnerabilities.  
- **Recommendation**: Update BIOS/UEFI to improve security, performance, and compatibility.

### Secure Boot
- Prevents unsigned or malicious bootloaders from executing during system startup.  
- Strongly recommended for systems exposed to untrusted environments.  
- **Recommendation**: Enable Secure Boot in BIOS/UEFI to protect the boot process (refer to manufacturer guide).

### Microcode Updates
- CPU microcode updates patch low-level vulnerabilities that software alone cannot fix.  
- **Recommendation**: Keep your OS updated.

### Virtualization Security
- CPU virtualization extensions can expand the attack surface, but IOMMU/VT-d mitigates DMA attacks.  
- **Recommendation**: Enable virtualization only if needed and activate IOMMU/VT-d when available (refer to manufacturer guide).
