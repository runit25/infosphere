# Security Recommendations

**Hyper-threading/SMT Mode increase your threat vector**

  - __Note__
  - Hyper-threading uses the same transistors already presently available on your CPU to increase performance by allowing multiple threads to run on the same physical core.
  - Resulting in a significant performance uplift depending on your workload at the cost of security, tdp and heat. Ultimately, however, it comes down to your threat model and risk tolerance.
  - Hyper-threading/SMT Mode can be disabled via your manufactors bios
