# 1. Arguably the fastest response 

Considerations
Does the affected user have access to an unmodified Windows installation media on a flash drive (as many people in IT do)? Allowing them to boot directly into a clean environment via the BIOS, thus bypassing potentially modified installation media. If not, is the user able to procure one, either from another (clean device) or acquaintance?

There's always the possibility that the user is facing an advanced threat that could potentially survive reinstalls; thus, identifying the threat vector is vital.

Data loss is another valid concern which needs to be appropriately addressed, including identifying backup procedures, as you may possibly reintroduce malware.

## 2. Identifying the threat vector

Tools such as FRST should be used prior to performing a reinstall. allowing the supportee to gauge the severity of the situation, paving a more appropriate path for the user
